# cozy-contact-cli

A little CLI to interact with your contact from the [Cozy](https://cozy.io/fr/) account.


### Why ?

At the moment the contact app are missing some features an so I have made a little cli in order to
respond quickly to some of my needs.

### What ?

This cli is able to do the following actions:

- **Normalize you phone number** to the international format (+33X...).
- **Remove the duplicate numbers** into a same contact.
- **Delete all your contact**.


### How to use it?

```
git clone https://github.com/Peltoche/cozy-contact-cli
yarn install
yarn start --url=https://mysuperinstance.mycozy.cloud
```
